      <h3> Project Scope </h3>
      <p>In a team of 3, we were tasked with designing the core functions of a mobile app for elderly care coordinators based on provided personas: Inez, an elderly woman in her late 70s with slight dementia, Hector, a busy nurse who has a short amount of time each day to check in on Inez, and Rosario, Inez's daughter and primary caregiver. This was a project completed in 3 weeks
      for the course Interaction Design Studio 1 at CMU.  </p>
      <p class="opportunities"><span class="opp-header">How Might We:</span></br>Create an app that allows Hector and Rosario communicate Inez's status descretly and not infringe upon Inez's independence?</p>
      <p class="my-role"><span class="role-header">My Role:</span></br>Designed and refined the app UI.</p>
      <p class="my-role">Led the team in brainstorming and project management.</p>

    <div id="process">
      <h3> Research Process</h3>
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_1.png">
      <p>We brainstormed about the ecosystem of elder care coordination, and then we did guerilla research via interviews. Afterwards, we created exploratory scenarios and created 3 exploratory storyboards from them. Furthermore, one of our group members referred to prior knowledge due to relevant work experience. </p>
      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We first wanted to get an idea of what we knew about the elderly care space, and with the addition of interviews
        we could pinpoint an area that we would like to design the app for. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br> Through the interviews, we found out that a major concern was having information option on the elderly's condition
      when caregivers are not physically present. </p>


    <h3 id="2"> Ideation </h3>
    <h2 class="process-stage-title">Storyboards and Exploratory Scenarios</h2>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_2.png">
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_4.png">
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_3.png">

      <p>We each created storyboards and scenarios based on the research we gathered and the personas provided to us.</p>


      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Exploring broad possibilities helps us to formulate 3 distinct ways in which the uCare app could be realized. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br> Our favorite idea was a smart pill bottle that used a connected scale to detect the weight change of individual pills. It would signal Inez when she should take her pill, and the weight change would be sent to Rosario letting her know that Inez has taken her medications.</p>

      <p class="insight"> We presented our findings and initial ideas in class, and based on the feedback, we decided to rethink
      our design and focus it more on the care givers rather than peripheral devices.</p>


      <p>We realized we weren’t taking advantage of the wide range of innate capabilities a mobile phone has. One of our preferred ideas was using a smart pill bottle, which we decided wasn’t focusing on the actual app itself.
        We also realized the other features and tasks in our storyboards was too obvious and there were already a plethora of apps that can handle such tasks. </p>

        <h2 class="process-stage-title">Back to the Drawing(White?)Board</h2>

        <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_5.png">
        <p>We first listed some of the potential values our app could provide, we thought we could narrow our focus to revolve around diet tracking and meal planning. But we didn’t want to just stop there, so we began to explore other possibilities. </p>

        <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_6.png">
        <p>We looked up all the innate capabilities of a smartphone (Accelerometer, Object-Recognition, Camera, Sensors etc.), and listed out possible ways our app could take advantage of that.
          We brainstormed how these capabilities could be used by having a “Yes… AND…” brainstorming session.  </p>

          <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_7.png">
          <p>We arrived at 3 possibilities of what our app could be, using a combination of innate smart phone functions below: </p>
          <p class="insight">Accelerometer  + Location to address a possible problem with Inez’s exercise and memory. </p>
          <p class="insight">Light Sensor to address sleep problems. </p>
          <p class="insight">Camera + Object Recognition to address macro/micro nutrients of food. </p>

          <p>We discussed the pros and cons of each of these possibilities, and decided on the <strong>Camera + Object Recognition</strong> feature. We felt this was the most realistic and practical scenario for our personas. We then took a deep dive in listing out how this could work for our app.  </p>

          <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_8.png">
          <p>After this brainstorming session, we wrote out a rough draft scenario (above) and then we created an updated final version of our scenario (below).  </p>

          <p id="narrative" style ="display: none; background-color: #f7f7f7; padding: 15px; border-radius: 3px;">
            Hector stops by at Inez’s house to visit her before heading to work. Inez is making dinner and Hector quickly snaps a picture of her meal using uCare. uCare scans the meal and saves the data. Later on that day, Rosario checks the uCare app and sees that the meal from earlier lacked some micronutrients. She sends Hector a suggestion through uCare so that he knows to remind Inez to include (x) with her meal tomorrow since she was lacking (x) today. Hector sees the suggestion that night and then tomorrow with the suggested food that he picked up from their local market. He suggests that she eat a (x). He updates the uCare app by selecting complete.
          </p>
          <p id="reveal">Read Scenario</p>

          <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_10.jpg">
          <p>To complement this scenario we drew a new storyboard to visualize how we envision the app to work.  </p>


    <!--<h2 class="process-stage-title">3 - Implementation</h2>-->
  <h3 id="3"> Implementation </h3>
  <p>Now that we have pin pointed the direction of where we want to go, we started to design our Lo-Fi, Mid-Fi, and Hi-Fi screens.</p>


<h2 class="process-stage-title">Wireframing</h2>
  <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_9.png">
  <p>We focused only on the most essential screens that would best convey the core functions of the app in relation to our scenarios.</p>

  <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>With only 3 weeks for the project, focusing on the meat of the app allows us to deliver the essential functions
  of uCare.</p>

  <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>Laying out the lo-fi screens was very straighforward, because we all had a very good idea of how the app functions due to our detailed exploratory phase.
</p>

<p>After this we created Mid-Fi wireframes and combined them with scenes from our storyboard/scenario to easily convey the interaction happening in each scene, and presented it to the class.</p>

<p>In this sequence, we are showing Hector using uCare's object recognition feature to get nutrition information from Inez's meals. This is then cross referenced with a diet plan
  Rosario has uploaded. If anything is detected as missing, Rosario will be notified and be able to send Hector a suggestion as to what to provide for Inez.</p>
</p>
<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>From the positive feedback we received in class, we then decided to flesh out the app into Hi-Fi screens.</p>
