      <h3> Project Scope </h3>
      <p>In a team of 3, we were tasked with designing the core functions of a mobile app for elderly care coordinators based on provided personas: Inez, an elderly woman in her late 70s with slight dementia, Hector, a busy nurse who has a short amount of time each day to check in on Inez, and Rosario, Inez's daughter and primary caregiver. This was a project completed in 3 weeks
      for the course Interaction Design Studio 1 at CMU.  </p>
    </div>

    <div id="process">
      <h3> Research Process</h3>
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_1.png">
      <p>We brainstormed about the ecosystem of elder care coordination, and then we did guerilla research via interviews. Afterwards, we created exploratory scenarios and created 3 exploratory storyboards from them. Furthermore, one of our group members referred to prior knowledge due to relevant work experience. </p>
      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We first wanted to get an idea of what we knew about the elderly care space, and with the addition of interviews
        we could pinpoint an area that we would like to design the app for. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br> Through the interviews, we found out that a major concern was having information option on the elderly's condition
      when caregivers are not physically present. </p>


    <h3 id="2"> Exploratory Phase </h3>
    <h2 class="process-stage-title">Storyboards and Exploratory Scenarios</h2>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_2.png">
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_4.png">
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/ucare_3.png">

      <p>We each created storyboards and scenarios based on the research we gathered and the personas provided to us.</p>


      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Exploring broad possibilities helps us to formulate 3 distinct ways in which the uCare app could be realized. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br> Our favorite idea was a smart pill bottle that used a connected scale to detect the weight change of individual pills. It would signal Inez when she should take her pill, and the weight change would be sent to Rosario letting her know that Inez has taken her meidcations.</p>

      <p class="insight"></br> We presented our findings and initial ideas in class, and based on the feedback, we decided rethink
      our design and focus it more on the care givers rather than periperhal devices.</p>


      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/lurker_map.jpg">
      <p>Eventually we consolidated our ideas and combined it with my own design.</p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>The house has an “ambulatory” design, meaning the player can move in a circular fashion
        through the space. We wanted the player to be able to have multiple options to enter and leave rooms during the player’s exploration.

      <p class="reason">Multiple entryways and doors means the player can gain access to different parts of the house quickly, and also escape from the ghost easier.
              However, this also means the ghost can follow the player he/she forgets
              to close doors during his/her exploration. In this sense, we wanted to foster an atmosphere of exploration and uncertainty for the player.</p>
            </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>With the house design finalized, we were
      able to envision where to place objects in the house and where the player and ghost can spawn. </p>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_sketch.png">
      <p>The next step was to figure out how collaboration was going to work in the game. We knew that we wanted the viewers to have access to separate screens from the streamer,
        but were not sure if Twitch or an external client were the better option for this task. Before making this decision, we decided to sketch some interfaces to see what exactly our final product would look like.   </p>

        <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Using that information, we could then make an educated decision about which outlet would give us the optimal results for our interface. </p>

        <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>The problem that we were asking ourselves was: how can we show the information from viewer side?
          The information includes: 1) chatting message. 2) ghost position information. </p>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_sketch_2.png">
      <p>For the website, we created a basic sketch of what we wanted it to feature.
      We decided to build a viewer interface in a website. This way, viewers are able to access the cameras in order to see the position of the ghost, and are able to interact with streamer. </p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Originally we thought we could integrate our UI into Twitch itself, however we realized that was not
      feasible in the initial 5 weeks we had.  </p>

    <p class="reason">Instead, we opted to stream the gameplay on a seperate website where we can easily custom build the UI we wanted for viewers
  to interact with.</p>

  <!--<h2 class="process-stage-title">3 - Implementation</h2>-->
  <h3 id="3"> Implementation </h3>
  <p> We decided that our game should have a narrative, so that the player can feel more immersive about the tasks he/she will have to accomplish in the game.</p>
  <p id="narrative" style ="display: none; background-color: #f7f7f7; padding: 15px; border-radius: 3px;"> Scene 1: Introduction<br><br>

 </p>
  <p id="reveal">Read Full Narrative (5min read)</p>

<h2 class="process-stage-title">Refining the in-game UI</h2>
  <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/radar_1.png">
  <p>We explored a simple UI for the player in the form of a mini-map or radar.</p>

  <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We wanted the player to be immersed in the game but also have
    an idea of his/her surroundings, and an actual Heads Up Display would take away from that. We decided the player can press a key to bring up some sort of navigation.</p>

  <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>Streamers have access to the layout of the house as well as the position of the ghost and themselves. This option makes the game more playable. However, it reduces the horror level.
</p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/radar_2.png">
<p>We decided to limit the information the player has to only roughly where the ghost is.</p>

<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Players can only know the relative position of ghost to themselves. Because this is the only information about the ghost and the house, the game's horror level increases.</p>

<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>In this scenario, streamers will try to communicate more with the viewers to figure out the ghost's location, on top of being on edge as he/she explores the house.
</p>

<h2 class="process-stage-title">Modeling the House</h2>
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/map_layout.png">
<p>As we moved forward with designing the house, we first figured out what should be in each room, and where the cameras should be facing.</p>

<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Having a good idea of where things are makes it alot easier to refer back on when building the house in 3D.</p>

<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>We found out we could leave some parts of the house camera-free, to produce a gap in the viewer's knowledge. We were also able to think about
  how each room should look in order to create a better horror atmosphere.
</p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/model_1.png">
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/model_2.png">
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/model_3.png">
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/model_4.png">
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/model_5.png">

<p>We created the house in Google SketchUp, and imported the 3D model into Unity later on.</p>

<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We opted for building the level outside of Unity to take advantage of SkethUp's efficient 3D modeling features.
We were able to iterate quickly and import those changes into Unity.</p>

<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>When we were adding textures to the model, we realized that certain patterns/colors evoke different emotions
  for a player (familiarity, fear, confusion etc.)
</p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_test.png">
<p> We created 3 iterations of Hi-Fidelity mock ups of the web interface which the viewers would use, and conducted user studies using them to validate the UI design decisions we were making. </p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_1.png">
<p> Solution 1 has a compact design, we sought to fit everything neatly. </p>
<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We wanted to have the map bigger, and we didn't think the chat will be active.</p>
<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>When testing with users, we found out that the chat is extremely important, and we could only see 3 messages at a time.
</p>
<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_2.png">
<p> In solution 2, we enlarged the chatbox and overlaid the map ontop of the camera stream. </p>
<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We thought the map overlaid ontop of the camera stream would look cool and make way for the bigger chat box.</p>
<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>Although the chat was bigger, users felt the overlay very distracting and interacting with it funky.</p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_3.png">
<p> In solution 3, we decided to sacrifice the screen real estate in order to fit both the chat box and map. </p>
<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We found out that the camera stream didn't have to be as big as the main stream, this paved way for putting the map next to it.</p>
<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>When we tested this, our users were very satisfied with the layout. Based on their feedback, we decided to stick with this solution.</p>

<img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_4.png">
<p> We implemented solution 3 using HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP for the backend. We also had to opt for still images from the camera instead of a live feed. </p>
<p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>We realized using a live feed for the camera feed was too complicated, instead we opted for a simpler solution.</p>
<p class="reason">We loaded the database with a set of still images that would trigger to show a version with a ghost if the ghost was in the room.</p>

<p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>Thanks to our user studies, we were able to code the website knowing the design decisions were validated.</p>

          <h3> What I Learned</h3>
          <p>The level design of a game greatly impacts the player experience! From the general layout down to the details. </p>

          <p>Sometimes for practicality purposes, a design mock-up must be changed in order to function.</p>

          <p>For a horror game, the lighting and atmosphere make or break how scary the game could be.</p>
