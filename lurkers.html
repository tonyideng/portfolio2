      <h3> Project Scope </h3>
      <p>This is an on-going group project at CMU. The first phase of the project was completed in 5 weeks as part of
        the class Twitch Game Design, in which our group was tasked to create a game/prototype that involves
        crowd participation and integration of the Twitch web platform. We created a survival horror game in which
      viewers through a website was able to interact with a Twitch streamer playing our game, as well as affecting
    the game outcome.  </p>
    </div>

    <div id="process">
      <h3> Process </h3>
      <h2 class="process-stage-title">1 - Concept</h2>
      <p>Our original idea was to create a horror game that utilizes the Twitch interface so as to promote collaboration as well as enable a unique type of horror experience
        across multiple screens to create a unique experience for both the streamer and the viewers. <br><br>
      It would consist of two parts: 1). The main game which the streamer plays 2). A web interface for the crowd to interact with the
    player and the game. </p>

      <h2 class="process-stage-title">2 - Ideation</h2>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/lurkers_sketch_1.png">
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/lurkers_sketch_2.png">

      <p>To begin the ideation process, we sketched house layouts and discussed how the house layout, atomosphere can affect possible game features.</p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>The level design of the game is the backbone in which the rest of the game will be built upon, tackling
      this challenge first would let us be more efficient in brainstorming how other features would fit the level. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br> Our first sketches and discussion revealed that we
      wanted a house with enough rooms for exploration but also feel open. </p>



      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/lurker_map.jpg">
      <p>Eventually we consolidated our ideas and combined it with my own design.</p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>The house has an “ambulatory” design, meaning the player can move in a circular fashion
        through the space. We wanted the player to be able to have multiple options to enter and leave rooms during the player’s exploration.

      <p class="reason">Multiple entryways and doors means the player can gain access to different parts of the house quickly, and also escape from the ghost easier.
              However, this also means the ghost can follow the player he/she forgets
              to close doors during his/her exploration. In this sense, we wanted to foster an atmosphere of exploration and uncertainty for the player.</p>
            </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>With the house design finalized, we were
      able to envision where to place objects in the house and where the player and ghost can spawn. </p>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_sketch.png">
      <p>The next step was to figure out how collaboration was going to work in the game. We knew that we wanted the viewers to have access to separate screens from the streamer,
        but were not sure if Twitch or an external client were the better option for this task. Before making this decision, we decided to sketch some interfaces to see what exactly our final product would look like.   </p>

        <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Using that information, we could then make an educated decision about which outlet would give us the optimal results for our interface. </p>

        <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>The problem that we were asking ourselves was: how can we show the information from viewer side?
          The information includes: 1) chatting message. 2) ghost position information. </p>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/web_sketch_2.png">
      <p>For the website, we created a basic sketch of what we wanted it to feature.
      We decided to build a viewer interface in a website. This way, viewers are able to access the cameras in order to see the position of the ghost, and are able to interact with streamer. </p>

    <div id="final-result">
      <h3> Final Result </h3>
      <p>After testing the Mid and Hi-Fi prototypes, I built an interactive version using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>

      <div id="pui-wrap">



      <p>The eventual web version had some visual differences from the mock ups and the paper prototypes, but the
      core functions remained the same. I leveraged CSS and JQuery animations to emulate the real user experience of
      using the app in mobile and web forms.

        <h2> Here's a summary of what I did & learned in this project: </h2>
    </div>

    <div id="whatlearndid">

        <div id="did">
        <h3> What I Did </h3>

        <p>Created rapid paper prototypes and conducted user tests to evaluate the effectiveness of each iteration.</p>

        <p>Used prototyping tools such as Sketch and Invision to visualize final design.</p>

        <p>Hand coded a functional mobile-optimized web prototype using HTML/CSS/JS from scratch.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="learned">
          <h3> What I Learned</h3>
          <p>Rapid iteration and testing prevented me from having tunnel vision, I realized early on I had missed some features
          that should've been there all along. </p>

          <p>Mid to Hi-Fi prototyping can reveal previouly overlooked features in Lo-Fi prototypes!</p>

          <p>Greatly improved my knowledge of CSS and JS because I didn't rely on templates or Bootstrap.</p>
