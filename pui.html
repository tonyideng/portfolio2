    TeamUp - Interactive Web Prototype

      <h3> Project Scope </h3>
      <p>This individual project was completed as part of the course Programming User Interfaces at CMU. I was tasked with creating a working prototype of a To-Do List Mobile App.
        The project started with Lo-Fi Paper Prototypes, then transitioned into Mid/Hi-Fi screen designs in Sketch and Invision. Finally it culminated in
      an interactive web prototype optimized for mobile view, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  </p>
    </div>

    <div id="process">
      <h3> Process </h3>
      <h2 class="process-stage-title">1 - Paper Prototypes & User Testing</h2>
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/paper1.jpg">
      <p>For the first iteration, my main goal was to layout the minimum functions needed for the app. This was created in-class
      within 20 minutes. </p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Constructing the most basic functions allowed me to test what I thought were the core functions of the app. </p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>The first user tests revealed that I should use progressive
      disclosure during the team creation phase of the app. This way I don't have to jam multiple buttons on one screen. </p>

      <p class="insight">I forgot to add any form of navigation for the user because I was so focused on one linear task.</p>


      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/pui-paper.jpg">
      <p>After several user tests of the first iteration, I consolidated the insights gained and updated my paper prototype with
      navigation, error messages, and additional screens for progressive disclosure. I then conducted 3 more user tests to test the validity of my update.</p>

      <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>By adding navigation, I can see how the user might want to explore different ways of interaction, as well
      as backtracking while doing a task.</p>

      <p class="reason">Error messages were added in order to better guide the user, as well as a way for me during user testing
        to see which parts of the prototype could be the most confusing.</p>

      <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>With navigation and error messages, the user tests became
      alot smoother. Error messages were not commonly needed however, because with navigation and additional, simpler screens, users
    were able to digest information quicker and easier. </p>


    <h2 class="process-stage-title">2 - Mid/Hi-Fi Prototyping using Sketch and InVision</h2>

      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/teamup_map.png">
      <p>After the second iteration of the paper prototype and the smooth user studies of the core functions of the app,
         It was ready to be fleshed out. </p>



    </div>

    <div id="final-result">
      <h3> Final Result </h3>
      <p>After testing the Mid and Hi-Fi prototypes, I built an interactive version using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>

      <p>The eventual web version had some visual differences from the mock ups and the paper prototypes, but the
      core functions remained the same. I leveraged CSS and JQuery animations to emulate the real user experience of
      using the app in mobile and web forms.

    </div>

    <div id="whatlearndid">

        <div id="did">
        <h3> What I Did </h3>

        <p>Created rapid paper prototypes and conducted user tests to evaluate the effectiveness of each iteration.</p>

        <p>Used prototyping tools such as Sketch and Invision to visualize final design.</p>

        <p>Hand coded a functional mobile-optimized web prototype using HTML/CSS/JS from scratch.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="learned">
          <h3> What I Learned</h3>
          <p>Rapid iteration and testing prevented me from having tunnel vision, I realized early on I had missed some features
          that should've been there all along. </p>

          <p>Mid to Hi-Fi prototyping can reveal previouly overlooked features in Lo-Fi prototypes!</p>

          <p>Greatly improved my knowledge of CSS and JS because I didn't rely on templates or Bootstrap.</p>
