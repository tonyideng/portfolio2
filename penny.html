        <p>The joy of microtransactions contains elements of the joy in gifting, except the latter is usually achieved through a physical gift. Furthermore, gifting inherently contains feelings of obligation. Project Penny touches upon the merging of the joys associated with physical gifts with a digital artifact, while removing the feelings of obligation into a spontaneous “gift-like” activity.  </p>

      <h3> Research Insights & Competitive Analysis </h3>


            <p>Sending money online has become as simple as a few taps on a smartphone, and there now exists a much larger market
            for designing around mobile payments. </p>

            <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Venmo</span></br>We used venmo as a case study for our idea: it requires the least effort
            to actually send money, and also that it's the most social of mobile payment apps. There is room to leverage Venmo's commenting/liking
          features for social connection. </p>
          <p class="insight">There is an entertainment value in "liking" a friend's public payment. Venmo's lack of anonymity is unique as well, one of us
          sent a celebrity a penny.</p>

          <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Yo</span></br>In the Yo app, you can send literally a word "Yo" to a friend, and nothing else. The novel "uselessness" of Yo likely contributed to its success.
          We saw the ephemeral popularity of Yo as an inspiration for building a similarly light-hearted app that may achieve viral success.</p>


          <h3> User Research Experiment 1: Pennies vs Potatoes </h3>
      <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/pennytater.jpg">
            <p> In this experiment, we had 5 participants send pennies to five of their friends on Venmo, and then send a picture of a potato-meme
            to a different set of friends. We asked all participants to reflect on their experience at the time and also after 48 hours to learn about any follow up interactions.</p>

            <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>Sending a penny on Venmo's comedic effect is not different than spreading a meme, we assumed that there is something specifically unique and
            entertaining about sending a penny to a friend that is more powerful than a meme. We wanted to test this assumption and not fall victim to the "correlation equals causation" fallacy.</p>

            <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>All participants echoed our thoughts about the novelty of sending pennies, they enjoyed the trolling nature specifically. Sending pennies was seen as more universal than sending a potato (which lead to awkward interactions). We decided it was best to continue our design around sending actual pennies rather than "valueless" memes. </p>

          <h3> User Research Experiment 2: Giant Pennies </h3>
          <img class ="process_pic" src ="images/pennygiant.jpg">
          <p>We designed a meme-themed penny and laser cut it into wood. Three of our team members gave five pennies to their friends (total of 15 people). We
          spontaneously gave it to a friend, and observed the reactions.</p>

          <p class="reason"><span class="reason-header">Why?</span></br>While we gained a better understanding of what it's like to give a penny, we also wanted
          to understand hwo people react to spontaneously-presented token gifts.</p>

          <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Findings</span></br> One fun reaction included <em> What is this, a drink toaster? </em> (a purpose for which it was promptly used). Another friend even mentioned she wanted to <b> buy </b> the fake penny!  </p>
          <p class="insight"><span class="insight-header">Insights</span></br>People enjoy reciving spontaneous gifts, even if the gift's identity was ambigous. All these gifts resulted in a brief conversation that otherwise would not have occured, this is a positive social outcome that we can use for good</p>

        <p>Participated in rapid prototyping and conducted user research to validate or bust our assumptions and design choices.</p>

          <h3> What I Learned</h3>
          <p>Rapid iteration and user research is a must for design, or else you will get tunnel vision and end with something unusable.  </p>

          <p>Adding animation can provide a feeling of fun and quirkiness in a design, as well as bring focus to important areas!</p>
